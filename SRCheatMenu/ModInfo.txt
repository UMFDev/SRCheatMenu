Press B to open the Cheat Menu while in-game.

Type "help srcm" in console to get a list of console commands this mod adds.

You can bind console commands to a button using bind.
Example: bind u spawn gold_slime 5
You can also save your binds so they are loaded the next time you start the game.
Example: savebinds AutoExec

Make sure you backup your save before using any of the unlock and reset commands.
